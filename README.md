# WIP: Retail Inventory Management System

**Status: Work in Progress**

## Introduction
Retail Inventory Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to tackle real-world challenges in retail inventory management. Developed as a solo assignment under the mentorship of TechBridge Inc, this application addresses key pain points in the retail sector, inspired by insights from Wal-Mart US CEO Greg Foran.

> "We’ve got too much inventory in the back rooms and our processes are not where we want them to be and that’s causing some undue shrinkage and some out-of-stocks," said Wal-Mart US CEO Greg Foran.
